# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Sales-Data
In this project I performed exploratory data analysis including cleaning, pre-processing the online sales dataset and fetching insights by data visualization.

#### Data Source: 
KAGGLE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samruddhi4040/online-sales-data
- Orders.csv contains Order ID (primary key), Order Date, CustomerName, State, City ->Customer details.
- Details.csv contains Order ID (primary key) and the details of all the subsequent orders within the Orders.csv ->Order details.

#### Overview:
I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an online sales dataset. Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I transformed raw data into actionable insights. Below are the key steps and findings:

#### Key Steps:
1. Data Collection:
- Sourced the dataset from Kaggle: Online Sales Data
- Two main files: Orders.csv (customer details) and Details.csv (order details)
2. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:
- Addressed missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Ensured data consistency and integrity
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Explored relationships between variables
- Visualized trends, patterns, and distributions
- Extracted meaningful insights
